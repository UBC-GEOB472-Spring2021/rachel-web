Collaborations:

Most of the help that I had received was in the beginning stages of this map creation. I wanted to know would help demonstrate inequalities experienced by women. I also wanted to celebrate women. I had a friend suggest spotlighting important women, and while this map is about the wage inequality in Canada, I decided to look on the financial side of it. I asked a wide group of friends to suggest BIPOC women owned businesses that they liked. I found quite a few on social media as well and narrowed it down to ten which were relatively spread out across Canada. I found the statistics of the gender wage gap on the Statistics Canada website. I uploaded my information onto geojson.io in order to add properties to them, and to easily upload them into MapBox. Then, I used Mapbox studio to create the aesthetic of the map and to combine my two layers: markers for BIPOC women owned businesses and the hourly wage inequality per province. Mapbox tutorials were very helpful for guidance in how to add interactivity. I used Atom to create the code for this project. Finally, I asked my friends to look it over and give me feedback about colors and portrayal. Everyone was happy with the shades of orange; however, the bright blue ocean color was too blue which took the focus away from the provinces. Therefore, I lightened the color of the ocean and chose a greyer tone. 

Reflective analysis: 

This map was created to visually portray the wage inequality of women in Canada in 2020. I designed this map to create awareness of this concern, especially in a time where people assume that society has progressed closer to equality. This can be informative for women who are looking for jobs across Canada. This is also informative for businesses on how there is a need to close this gap. Using the statistics from Statistics Canada, I compared the average hourly pay for both men and women in the goods and services producing sectors. This is how I found the gaps. The goods producing sectors had a much higher inequality rate in every province compared to the services sector. This is why I included both in the top-right box when you run your mouse over each province. The legend in the bottom right corner of the screen divides the classes of the average of both goods and services sector hourly wage inequalities. Each class is represented in a different orange hue which becomes darker as the wage gap increases. I wanted the audience to focus on those areas the most since they need more attention. I believe that the colors that I chose and the information available to the reader is successful in emphasizing my message. 
Since I wanted to celebrate women, I wanted to bring focus on businesses of women who experience intersectionality in society constantly. I wanted to give the audience resources for businesses that are close to them which they can support through their purchases. These businesses include fashion, food, gifts, home décor, and food. While some of these may be more geared towards females, it can be interesting for everyone. It was hard to choose only 10, but I did not want to add too much interactivity that it would take away from the overall idea. To improve this map, I would add more information for every marker representing the businesses. I could have included addresses and phone numbers, or external links to social media to help these companies gain a larger following. Additionally, I would have used the ‘mousemove’ function with the markers. I do not like how you need to click on and exit every popup for each marker.
