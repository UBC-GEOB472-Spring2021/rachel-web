Hi everyone! Thank you for checking out my map.

This map depicts the location of homeless shelters in Vancouver. Each point includes the name of the facility, who can go there, and the phone number that they can be contacted at. This map is used for navigational purposes and to offer a helpful resource to those who need it. Additionally, we can see many shelters that are located close together in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, demonstrating which areas in Vancouver are most in need of these resources. It poses questions as to why there are little to none in other areas of Vancouver, what patterns urban areas produce and the underlying issues that construct the need for shelters. It is important to be knowledgeable of where these exist to be resourceful within our communities, especially in the cold months of winter where these locations serve as potentially lifesaving warming shelters. 

I chose the navigational style within MapBox studio to highlight important navigational landmarks. Road names, highways, and transit stations are clearly labelled. I also changed the brightness and size of the transit station icons to make them move obvious to the map reader. Additionally, the dark color scheme of the map makes the important elements pop. It is very neutral because I did not want too many different colors or labels to make it harder for the map reader to distinguish between elements. I also used an icon that depicts a shape of a generic location marker, except I found one that also included a house symbol within it. I chose this icon to make the goal of the map more obvious at first glance. I also designed it so that the size of the symbol changes at different zoom levels so that it is always visible to the map reader but does not overrepresent the space that each address covers. Additionally, I designed 3D buildings that appear when you zoom into the map. This gives the map reader a more authentic view closer to street level. I also made the parks greener to provide clear landmarks for reference. 
If I were to change anything about my map, I would change the color of the location icon. Looking back, I do not think that the icon stands out enough against the dark scale of colors in the background. Or, I would opt for a lighter background that still disguises elements that are not important to the goal of the map. The contrast between colors may not be making a big enough statement of what I want my map to depict. 

Critique session: I had asked a couple of friends to look over my map. Overall, they liked the data that was depicted and found the color scale aesthetically pleasing. Originally, I had two different colors of icons representing the locations of the shelters. One is my current black one to represent that they offer meals, and the other was transparent with a black outline to visually represent that they do not. I would have made a legend to convey this. However, feedback from friends allowed me to realize that the visual hierarchy was not conveying my message, and that it would be more visually appealing to use only the black icon.
